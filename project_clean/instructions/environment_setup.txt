notes on code to use the libraries

using the mysql-connector-python
    import mysql.connector as connector
    connection=connector.connect(user="root",password="your_password")

    OR - MORE ROBUST

    try:
    connection=connector.connect(
        user="meta",
        password="password",
        database = "no_database")

    except connector.Error as er:
        print("Error code:", er.errno)
        print("Error message:", er.msg)

    USE the library to manipulate the database

    --- create sql code and execute

    cursor.execute("USE database_name")

    sql_query="""
    PUT YOUR SQL QUERY IN A DOCSTRING
    """
    cursor.execute(sql_query)

    COUSUME THE CURSOR
    cursor.execute(sql_query_2"")
    for k in cursor:
        print(k)


    CLOSE THE CONNECTION

    if connection.is_connected():
        connection.close()
        print("MySQL connection is closed.")
    else:
        print("Connection is already closed")
